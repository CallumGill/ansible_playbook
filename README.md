# Ansible Playbook Docker Image

Executes ansible-playbook command against an externally mounted set of Ansible playbooks

```
docker run --rm -it -v PATH_TO_LOCAL_PLAYBOOKS_DIR:/ansible/playbooks philm/ansible_playbook PLAYBOOK_FILE
```

For example, assuming your project's structure follows [best practices](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_best_practices.html#directory-layout), the command to run ansible-playbook from the top-level directory would look like:

```
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/ansible/playbooks philm/ansible_playbook site.yml
```

Ansible playbook variables can simply be added after the playbook name.

## SSH Keys

If Ansible is interacting with external machines, you'll need to mount an SSH key pair for the duration of the play:

```
docker run --rm -it \
    -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa \
    -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
    -v $(pwd):/ansible/playbooks \
    philm/ansible_playbook site.yml
```

## Ansible Vault

If you've encrypted any data using [Ansible Vault](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html), you can decrypt during a play by either passing **--ask-vault-pass** after the playbook name, or pointing to a password file. For the latter, you can mount an external file:

```
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/ansible/playbooks \
    -v ~/.vault_pass.txt:/root/.vault_pass.txt \
    philm/ansible_playbook site.yml --vault-password-file /root/.vault_pass.txt
```                    

Note: the Ansible Vault executable is embedded in this image. To use it, specify a different entrypoint:

```
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/ansible/playbooks --entrypoint ansible-vault philm/ansible_playbook encrypt FILENAME
```
